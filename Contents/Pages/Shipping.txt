In the pursuit of finding premium and unique products for you, CRAVVIT believes that the make and the cultural origin of our product should not be limited to only one country. Therefore we have gone International to choose the best craftsman for our products.
<br /><br />
The shipping origin of CRAVVIT spreads across different parts of the world, primarily from America, Middle-East, and South-East.
<br /><br />
Based on that our <strong>standard order delivery time is **2 to 5 Weeks</strong>, which constitutes of two factors: <em>Order processing time and Shipping time.</em>
</div>

<div>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Order Processing Time</span>: 
<br />After an order is placed and confirmed at <a href="https://www.cravvit.com" target="_blank" title="cravvit.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">cravvit.com</a>, it takes around <em>2 to 5 Business Days</em> to process the order i.e. to make it ready for International Transit. 
<br /><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping Time</span>: 
<br />To incur Minimum possible<em> (NO SHIPPING CHARGE in most of the cases)</em> to its customers worldwide, CRAVVIT uses <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/international-shipping.htm" target="_blank" title="USPS Commercial ePacket Service" rel="noopener noreferrer">USPS Commercial ePacket Service</a> for standard International shipping. The average standard shipping time is <em>**2 to 4 Weeks</em>. 
<br /><br />
<strong>**EXCEPTION**</strong>
<br />Though very rare, but due to Cross-border International Shipment Processing including any customs delay or High Order Volume in Festive Seasons or any other unforeseen situation, some unfortunate logistics circumstances may arise, which are beyond our control. These might lead to some unwanted occurrences including, but not limited to the following:
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Unexpected shipping delay, exceeding our standard 2 to 5 Weeks Shipping time. </li>
<li>Package not arriving/ Getting Lost during transit </li>
</ul>
In these cases, we have a <strong><em>60-day Shipment Delay Refund Policy </em></strong>which accords that if the order delivery is taking more than 60 days from placing the order, then the customer is eligible for a full refund or replacement (subjected to stock availability), as he/she wishes.
<br /><br />
CRAVVIT believes in benefits to customers, transparency, and obligation to its customers. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Benefits of ePacket Shipping:</strong>
<br />
International shipping comes with a hefty price tag, often in a range of $30 to $50 for light items. CRAVVIT avoids this by using USPS ePacket service to make its benefits available to the customers like:
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Reliability of USPS - The United States Postal Service.</li>
<li>Minimum to No Shipping Charge</li>
<li>Door to Door Shipment Tracking</li>
<li>Custom &amp; Import Tax-Free (Most of the time)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Return/ Replacement Shipping:</strong>
<br />While returning or replacing an item - 
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>The customer is responsible for all back and forth shipping and brokerage charges for returns or exchanges.</li>
<li>International shipments should be marked as a "Merchandise Return" with a carrier that does not levy brokerage fees. The customer is responsible for any applicable brokerage or customs charges. If you are shipping an item over $50, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance.</li>
<li>All other applicable conditions and terms of our <em>Return &amp; Refund Policy</em> apply to international returns. </li>
</ul>

<strong>Customs &amp; Import Taxes (If Applicable):</strong>
Though ePacket Shipping is Duty &amp; Tax-free in most of the cases, if, for some reason, these taxes are imposed on your order by your country's customs department, then they need to be paid by you. Import duties, taxes or other customs charges, if applicable, will be collected by the shipping company upon delivery.
