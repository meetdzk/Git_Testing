Hey! Hi!
<br /><br />
First of all, thanks for spending your time to know us better. This means we've done something good somewhere, that has made you feel good about us. 
Well, that makes us feel good about us.<br /><br />Like every other great story, our story also has its ups n downs and that <em>ZING</em> moment. Let's dive in then.
<br /><br />
This story has two characters - Jack &amp; Jill, two passionate and young talented beings who wanted to do so much with their life. They finished up their college 
in 2012 and in the mid of 2013, they got their jobs as IT Engineers in a Multinational Corporation (Infosys Ltd.) with a very basic payroll. Life was good and everybody
was happy.
<br /><br />
Time passed and things started to change - both in the good and bad way. The good thing was, Jack fell in love with Jill and the best thing was, it was not just one 
directional.
<br /><br />
Love was in the air. Everything was magical for them. La la la lala...la la lala...
<br /><br />
oh! oops! where was I? Yes, the good things and the bad things.
<br /><br />
The bad thing was, unknowingly both of them were falling into this never ending 9 to 7 (9 am to 7 pm) monotonous work life abyss. Everything was pretty same. 
Same alarm, same activities, same route to the office, same monitor &amp; keyboard, and the same BOSS. They had literally no time for each other, no time for family, 
no new adventures, no new challenges...JUST NOTHING.
<br /><br />
This went on until one day, when they decided to take some action and change everything, once and for all, to bring adventure back to their life again, to face new 
challenges again, to become passionate again...TO BECOME THEM AGAIN.
<br /><br />
They wanted to pursue something that they were passionate about.
<br /><br />
Jack always wanted to be an entrepreneur - to do something of his own, to be his own boss.
<br />
Jill was always curious about fashion, beauty and health (yeah...obviously...GIRLS).
<br /><br />
Finally, it was the brainstorming part where they had to come up with an idea which would unite both's interests. After much thoughts and Caffeine, they decided to 
set up an online store of premium fashion accessories. But both of them were very sure of one thing that they won't be general and put everything into the store that 
they can put their hands on.
<br /><br />
Their product should not be limited to the concept of quality and price, but go beyond it. It should have THE CRAVE FACTOR in it, which would make others CRAVE IT 
when they see it.
<br /><br />
Keeping this in mind, they decided to handpick each and every product and curate everything from start to end themselves.
<br />
This was tough, tiring and challenging but I promise they enjoyed every bit of it.
<br /><br />
Well...there it is. It was the fall of 2016 when the day finally came. They could mold their days, months and years of relentless hard work and give it a shape.
<br /><br />
Enter CRAVVIT.
<br /><br />
Call it satisfaction, anxiety, hope, enthusiasm or dedication, but for them it was an experience and a tremendous one.
<br />
But you know Jack &amp; Jill, they always love to take things to the next level.
<br />
On 4th Dec 2016, Jack and Jill got married. Remember the zing moment...well, this was it.
